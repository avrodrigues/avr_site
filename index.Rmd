I am biologist, with deep interest in forest ecosystems, in particular the Atlantic Forest. I have worked with functional ecology of forests plants, macroecology, macroevolution and biogeography.

Currently, I develop my doctorate thesis at [Phylogenetic and Functional Ecology Lab](https://www.ufrgs.br/leff/) in the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil. In this project I am interested in how processes of diversification, dispersion, and niche evolution drive patterns of diversity in Atlantic Forest. 

I love to code in R and build tools with Shiny. I have experience in using multivariate statistics, phylogenetic analysis, species distribution modeling, gathering, and tiding ecological data. 

Do we have common interests? 
Do you think I can contribute with you in anyway?
